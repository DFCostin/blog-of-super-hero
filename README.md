# Angular Superhero Maintenance Application

This Angular application allows you to manage a superhero maintenance system. It includes features for filtering, listing, creating, editing, and deleting superheroes. The project follows best practices for project structure, formatting, optimization, and type safety.

## Features

### Filter and List

- Input field for filtering superheroes by name, with optimized event handling.
- Edit button to navigate to the edit page, displaying the selected superhero's data.
- New superhero button to navigate to the creation page.
- Display superhero names with the first letter capitalized.
- Delete superhero button to prompt for confirmation before deleting the superhero.

### Create / Edit

- Form with fields for creating/editing superheroes.
- Navigation to the superhero list after creating/editing a superhero.
- Display superhero names in uppercase.

### Other Elements

- Service: Data can be mocked or connected to a real API. If using a service with mocked data, simulate API calls using observables.
- Loader: Display a loader while data is being fetched.
- Notifications: Show informative messages to the user after creating/modifying/deleting an element or in case of an error.

## Additional Considerations

- Utilize Angular Material for visual components.
- Include tests for components.
- Use reactive programming.
- Modularize components for better maintainability.
